# Line and Branch coverage

## Branch Coverage
* Whether or whether the tests cover the branches is determined by branch coverage. It's a white box testing method that examines each code component's output. Branch coverage ensures that each selection criteria from each branch is appropriately executed at least once. You should test both False and True discoveries if the results are binary, for example. It aids you in verifying that no branches cause any anomalies in the execution of the program.

## Line Coverage
* The quantity of performed lines divided by the overall number of lines is the Line Coverage of a program. Simply lines holding executable commands, not lines having only declarations, are analyzed. The line coverage analysis identifies which lines were discovered as a result of your testing.Â  It's a statistic for counting and calculating how many lines in source code have been executed. We can use this way to figure out what the script should and shouldn't do.
