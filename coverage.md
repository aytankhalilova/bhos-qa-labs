# Line and Branch coverage

* Branch Coverage
** Whether or whether the tests cover the branches is determined by branch coverage. It's a white box testing method that examines each code component's output. Branch coverage ensures that each selection criteria from each branch is appropriately executed at least once. You should test both False and True discoveries if the results are binary, for example. It aids you in verifying that no branches cause any anomalies in the execution of the program.
